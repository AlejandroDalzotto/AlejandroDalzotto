# Hi there, my name is Alejandro üëã

I work as a **Freelance Full Stack Web Developer**, mainly using Next, the React framework for the web and sometimes developing web pages with Astro, the web framework for content-driven websites.

Recently, I have been exploring the world of cross-platform software development by working with technologies like **Tauri**, a framework for creating cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies, and **Rust**, a systems programming language focused on safety and performance.

I have also been learning and implementing new technologies for myself, such as **GitHub Actions** for workflow automation.

I completed a **Programming Technical Degree** at the National Technological University (UTN) of Argentina.

That's a lot of technologies I got to say, but I always try to keep my focus on the ones I enjoy the most, which are **Next.js** and **TypeScript.**

As I said above, I'm currently leaning about Tauri and Rust. Develope desktop applications with web technologies is something I always wanted to achieve, and now I can do it!

## üå∫ Projects I've worked on

- [‚úçüèª Taking Notes](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/taking-notes/releases/latest): A simple, user-friendly desktop app to centralize and manage your `.txt` and `.md` notes.

### Some unfinished projects I'd like to complete in the near future

- [üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ Varano](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/varano): An application developed to help educational institutions manage their data securely and easily through an intuitive user interface, providing various tools to assist in searching for registered data.
- [üìö Zephyr Translator](https://zephyr-translator.vercel.app/): A Next.js-powered website that leverages AI to translate text between English and Spanish.

#### Last but not least, some of my code projects I've made to practice and learn new technologies

- [Wordle Console](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/wordle-console): A console-based Wordle clone built with `Kotlin`, created to explore the language and its capabilities.
- [Devdle](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/devdle): A programming language-themed Wordle variant made with `Qwik`, focused on learning the framework and its zero-JS delivery.
- [Codeffee](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/codeffee): A simple website to practice how components, state management, and UI design work together using the framework and its ecosystem. Also one of my first Next.js projects.
- [Frontdev Resources](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/frontdev-resources): A resource-sharing site for frontend developers, built with `Astro`. This project helped me understand the view transitions API and its practical use.

This tracking consists of keeping the products that are added and removed up to date on a daily basis. It's my first full-stack project, built with `Angular` and `Spring Boot`, which I completed as my final degree project.
