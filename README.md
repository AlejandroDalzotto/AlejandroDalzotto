# Hi there 👋🏻

I'm Alejandro, a web developer based in Argentina.

I build fancy, fast, and complete web applications. If you got an idea, I can build it and ship it.

I mainly use Next.js, tailwind, and typescript. Recently, I have been also exploring the world of cross-platform software development by working with technologies like Tauri, a framework for creating cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies, and Rust, a systems programming language focused on safety and performance.

If you want to talk to me, you can reach me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-dalzotto-44214a24b/) or via [email.](mailto:aledalzotto15@gmail.com)

### Some unfinished projects I'd like to complete in the near future

- [📚 Zephyr Translator](https://zephyr-translator.vercel.app/): A Next.js-powered website that leverages AI to translate text between English and Spanish.

#### Code projects I've made to practice and learn new technologies

- [Wordle Console](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/wordle-console): A console-based Wordle clone built with `Kotlin`, created to explore the language and its capabilities.
- [Devdle](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/devdle): A programming language-themed Wordle variant made with `Qwik`, focused on learning the framework and its zero-JS delivery.
- [Codeffee](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/codeffee): A simple website for a non real cafeteria to practice how components, state management, and UI design work together using `Next.js` and its ecosystem. Also one of my first Next.js projects.
- [Frontdev Resources](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/frontdev-resources): A resource-sharing site for frontend developers, built with `Astro`. This project helped me understand the view transitions API and its practical use.
- [Game of Life](https://github.com/AlejandroDalzotto/game-of-life): Conway's Game of Life implemented with `Next.js` and managed by `Bun`, created to compare developer experience and performance with different package managers.

This tracking consists of keeping the products that are added and removed up to date on a daily basis. It's my first full-stack project, built with `Angular` and `Spring Boot`, which I completed as my final degree project.
